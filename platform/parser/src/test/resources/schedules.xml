                    Confessions of Activists Who Try But Fail to Avoid Proprietary Software

                <abstract>
                    <p>The FOSS community suffers deeply from a fundamental paradox: every day, there are more lines of
                        freely licensed code than ever in history, but, every day, it also becomes slightly more
                        difficult to operate productively using only Open Source and Free Software.
                    </p>
                </abstract>
                <description>
                    <p>In one sense, we live in the paramount of success of FOSS: developers can easily find jobs
                        writing mostly freely licensed software. Companies, charities, trade associations, and
                        individual actors collaborate together on the same code bases in (relative) harmony. The entire
                        Internet would cease to function without FOSS. Yet, the "last mile" of the most critical
                        software that we rely on in our daily lives is usually proprietary.
                    </p>
                    <p>We, the presenters of this talk, live as the canaries in the coalmine of proprietary software. We
                        have spent our lives seeking to actively avoid proprietary software but both personally and
                        professionally, we find ourselves making compromises. In this talk, we will report the results
                        of our diligent efforts to use only FOSS in our daily work.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ideally, it would be possible to live a software freedom lifestyle in the way a vegetarian lives
                        a vegetarian lifestyle: minor inconveniences at some restaurants and stores, but generally most
                        industrialized societies provide opportunity and resources to support that moral choice. Not so
                        with proprietary software: often, the compromise is between "spend hours or days for a task that
                        would take mere minutes with proprietary software". In other cases, important opportunities are
                        simply not offered to those who chose software freedom.
                    </p>
                    <p>The advent of network services, which mix server-side secret software, and proprietary Javascript
                        or "Apps", are central to the decline in the ability to live a productive, convenient life in
                        software freedom. However, few in our community focus on the implications of this and related
                        problems, and few now even try to resist. We have tried to resist, and while we have succeeded
                        occasionally, we have failed overall to live life in software freedom.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this talk, we will report on where the resistance fails the most and why. Finally, we will
                        make suggestions of where volunteer developers can most strategically focus their efforts to
                        build a world where all can live in software freedom.

                        for joining the new world of Electric Vehicle Hacking. Do you want to help to bring some Freedom
                        to our cars? My 'Tesla Hacking' evolved to a broader project 'FreedomEV'.

                    <p>The current state of Tesla Hacking. Difficulties. Strategies. What has been done and what is
                        possible? The creation of an opensource platform for hacking electric Linux-based vehicles. We
                        will launch the website http://www.freedomev.com to bring our hacks to the world and allow
                        others to contribute in the repository. Debian-style.
                    </p>
                    <p>It started out with hacking my Tesla Model X. And is evolving now into a community project which
                        seeks your cooperation to build new exciting features into Electric Vehicles. Welcome to the
                        launch of FreedomEV!
                    </p>
                    <p>The FreedomEV project aims to give you full control over your own vehicle. Over it's security and
                        full features and capabilities. The future possibilities are endless. We explore how we are
                        doing this, why, and what is possible. Consider this a call for your participation as well.
                        Currently only supporting Tesla Model S and X with ARM MCU, but looking to broaden vehicle
                        support to include Intel based MCU's and Tesla Model 3 and possibly other manufacturers too?
